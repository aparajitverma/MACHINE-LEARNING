Decision tree classifiers are utilized as a well known classification technique in different pattern recognition issues, 
for example, image classification and character recognition. Decision tree classifiers perform more successfully, specifically 
for complex classification problems, due to their high adaptability and computationally effective features. Besides, 
decision tree classifiers exceed expectations over numerous typical supervised classification methods .
