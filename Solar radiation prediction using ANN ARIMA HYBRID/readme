Solar radiation prediction using Hybrid model of ANN and SARIMAX

DATASET USED: city of Jaiselmer,Jodhpur,Bikaner,Barmer(dataset uploaded too)

SARIMAX(with parameter) - class statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax.SARIMAX(endog, exog=None, order=1, 0, 0, seasonal_order=0,
0, 0, 0, trend=None, measurement_error=False, time_varying_regression=False, mle_regression=True, 
simple_differencing=False, enforce_stationarity=True, enforce_invertibility=True, hamilton_representation=False, 
concentrate_scale=False, trend_offset=1, use_exact_diffuse=False, dates=None, freq=None, missing='none', **kwargs)

Artificial Neural Network -The parameters of a neural network are typically the weights of the connections. In this case, 
these parameters are learned during the training stage. So, the algorithm itself (and the input data) tunes these parameters.

I have made hybrid model by using SARIMAX first then using its result on ANN

Sarimax is used for time series forecasting for seasonal and linear data. ANN is used for non liner part

I have uploaded certain case studies and also included mine.I found these results:
1)Radiation depends on months. As certain months are hotter than other
2)The target (y) is GHI (Global Horizontal Irradiance) whose radiation occurs only in sunlight.
3) Model came out to be 96% accurate
