K means clustering

k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, 
that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs 
to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster. 

K Nearest Neighbors - Classification
K nearest neighbors is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a 
similarity measure (e.g., distance functions). KNN has been used in statistical estimation and pattern recognition already 
in the beginning of 1970â€™s as a non-parametric technique
Algorithm		
A case is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the case being assigned to the class most common amongst its 
K nearest neighbors measured by a distance function. If K = 1, then the case is simply assigned to the class of its nearest neighbor.
